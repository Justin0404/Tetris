from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:

Tetris is a very popular falling blocks puzzle game, 
released on a large spectrum of platforms. 
Alexey Pajitnov originally designed and programmed the game in June of 1985.

A pseudorandom sequence of tetrominoes 
- shapes composed of four square blocks each - fall down the playing field. 
The object of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each 
one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating 
a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, 
it disappears, and the blocks above (if any) fall.
The game ends when the player "tops out", that is, when the stack of 
tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes 
are able to enter. 

Players refer to the seven one-sided tetrominoes in Tetris as I, J, L, O, S, T, and Z. 
All are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. 
Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, 
and this is referred to as a "tetris." 

You can play in a default tetris-world (10 colums, 22 rows) or you can choose a
different size by calling the parameterized constructor of class TerisWorld.
Start a game by pressing the Run-button.
Press the "left"-cursor to move a tetromino to the left.
Press the "right"-cursor to move a tetromino to the right.
Press the "up"-cursor to rotate a tetromino.
Press the "down"-cursor or the SPACE-key to drop a tetromino quickly to the bottom row.
